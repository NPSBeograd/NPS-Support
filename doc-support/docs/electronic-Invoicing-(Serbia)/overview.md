# Overview

**NPS Electronic Invoicing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**

In accordance with electronic invoicing the direct communication with the System of Electronic Invoices (Serbian: SEF) is enabled through invoice exchanges between companies (both public and private).

Sending of sales invoices and receiving of purchase invoices is both done through official Web services that are provided by the Tax Administration. The prerequisite for application of this method of communication is that the company must be registered on the SEF portal based on a certificate held by an authorized person who has the ability to apply for a tax return.

After registering on the SEF portal, it is necessary to setup system settings (Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central) according to the steps further explained in this manual.
Also, this instruction includes the steps to be followed in operational work with documents.

Types of documents to be either received or sent are:

•	Invoice or prepayment invoices

•	Finance charge memo

•	Credit memo or correction of prepayment invoices

•	Final invoice (after prepayment invoice)
